\subsection{Diagrams}

We have updated the vocabulary in the diagram obj-diagram.png to reflect 
an accurate description of the roles of various processes in the system.

\subsection{Progress}

We can adequately render spheres with diffuse color, and load a scene from
an external description. We are able to render frames in independent processes,
but cannot yet render a single image across multiple processes. 

\subsection{Vocabulary}

We have transitioned from the terms ``Client'' and ``Server'' to the terms
``Worker'' and ``Collector.'' Worker processes handle rendering of an arbitrary
chunk of the image, which it then sends to the collector process, which collects
rendered chunks and assembles them into a finished image.
