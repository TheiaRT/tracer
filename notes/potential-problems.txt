1. Client currently only has two states: NEED_WORK and WORKING. Upon finishing
work, the client must send the work back in one message and then ask for more in
another. This may be more overhead than we want.

2a. Server currently sends scenes with each message, which a) may be more
overhead than is acceptable and b) is not necessary. Adding another message type
with more information like "I have the scene" could make a difference.

2b. Additionally, sending only the filename of the scene limits the clients to
one machine or machines with access to a shared filesystem. Clients on remote
machines in future implementations will need to receive the scene over the
wire. This has far more significant latency concerns than just a filename.
