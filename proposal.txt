DETAIL

0. ABSTRACT

We write a render server that, given n > 0 computers and a list of frames,
distributes the rendering. This is a classic Producer-Consumer problem.

1. USE CASE

Suppose you have a film you are rendering. This film has a lot of hair, a lot of
snow, and a lot of water. And they're ALL MOVING. As you may already know, all
of those things are very computationally difficult to render. What if, though,
you had a mass of computers at the ready, each with the capacity to render a
single frame? Brilliant! Problem solved.
