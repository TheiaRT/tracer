DETAIL

0. ABSTRACT

We write a render server that, given n > 0 computers and a list of frames,
distributes the rendering. This is a classic Producer-Consumer problem. The
producers each render frames and the consumer joins them into a movie file,
perhaps (according to codec) with compression.

1. USE CASES

Suppose you have a film you are rendering. This film has a lot of hair, a lot of
snow, and a lot of water. And they're ALL MOVING. As you may already know, all
of those things are very computationally difficult to render. What if, though,
you had a mass of computers at the ready, each with the capacity to render a
single frame? Brilliant! Problem solved.

Suppose your computer is so terrible that it takes 5ever to render a single
frame. Then you might say, "Welp, I'm done for. Can't even render a frame - how
will I ever render a movie?" THIS JUST IN! Our project can help you split up an
individual frame and render that across several computers! We just hope for your
sake that the latency doesn't hurt the effort.
